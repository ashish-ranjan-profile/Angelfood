  <p style="padding-left: 3rem; padding-right: 3rem; padding-top: 3rem; padding-bottom: 2rem;">The Food Waste Management project [ Angelfood ] aims to address food wastage by collecting excess and leftover food from various donors, including hotels, restaurants, and marriage halls. 
    This collected food is then distributed to support poor, orphaned, and needy individuals. By doing so, the project not only helps in reducing food wastage but also ensures that surplus food reaches those who are in dire need of nourishment. 
    This initiative operates on a systematic approach where donors can easily contribute their excess food. A dedicated team manages the collection, ensuring that the food is handled safely and hygienically during transportation. Once collected, the food is promptly delivered to orphanages, shelters, and communities struggling with food insecurity. 
    The project emphasizes collaboration with local businesses and community organizations, creating a network that supports sustainability and social responsibility. By transforming potential waste into valuable resources, the Food Waste Management project addresses hunger and poverty, making a significant positive impact on society.</p>
